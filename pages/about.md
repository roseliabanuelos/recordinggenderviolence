## About the Collection

    Titled "A Rapist in Your Path,” the stirring resistance act is part of a new global movement to address transnational violations of women’s rights. Brought to life last fall in Chile, it has been replicated 367 times in 52 countries, and on every continent except for Antarctica. This was it's replica in Houston.

Gender/Domestic/Intimate Partner violence is the willful intimidation, physical assault, battery, sexual assault, and/or other abusive behavior as part of a systematic pattern of power and control perpetrated by one intimate partner against another. It includes physical violence, sexual violence, and emotional abuse.

Relevant Statistics:
"The Houston Area Women's Center reports it saw a 65% rise in domestic violence calls to its hotline, from 2,795 calls in September 2019 to 4,604 calls in September 2020." (https://abc13.com/domestic-violence-mayra-moreno-abc13-town-hall-avda/8047331/)

"The number of deaths in 2020 increased 7% from 772 to 826. A total of 54 more children from 2019." (https://www.click2houston.com/news/local/2021/04/01/houston-area-seeing-a-surge-in-child-deaths-from-abuse-and-neglect/) 

"Domestic violence happens every minute, mostly behind closed doors.
In America, 24 people per minute experience rape, physical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner.
Nearly 30% of women and 10% of men experience rape, physical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner in America each year.
Roughly 25% of women and 14% of men have been suffered serious physical injuries as a result of physical violence by an intimate partner.
Nearly half of all women and men in America have experienced psychological aggression by an intimate partner.
Females ages 18-34 experience the highest level of intimate partner violence in the United States.
Nearly 50% of female homicides in the United States are committed by former or current intimate partners.
Intimate partner violence has grown by an estimated 40% in Harris County alone during COVID-19." (https://crime-stoppers.org/domestic-violence/)

"Not only is intimate partner femicide the most extreme consequence of intimate partner violence, it also has a strong and prolonged impact on women’s surroundings. For example, surviving children of women killed by their intimate partners experience long-lasting effects, since they lose one parent to the murder, the other parent to jail, and often have to leave their parental home and adjust to a new environment in which they might be labelled as the child of the murderer.

Based on this World Health Organization list, the countries where femicide occurs most often are El Salvador, Venezuela, the Central African Republic, South Africa, Jamaica, Honduras, Guatemala, Guyana and Mexico."

The collection began as a discovery of key words related to domestic violence within periodicals of Arte Público Press (APP). The collection quickly grew as key words continued to appear in the periodicals themselves and through parallel research external to APP. Gender violence continues to wreak havoc through our world.

The following readings are the result of parallel research and point to the possible directions of the collection;

"Concerns about the negative effects of prolonged exposure to violent television programming emerged shortly after broadcasting began in 1946. By 1972 sufficient empirical evidence had accumulated for the U.S. Surgeon General to comment that "...televised violence, indeed, does have an adverse effect of certain members of our society". Other scientific bodies have come to similar conclusions. Six major professional societies in the United States - the American Psychological Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the American Psychiatric Association - recently concluded that " the data point overwhelmingly to a causal connection between media violence and aggressive behavior in some children."

Brandstetter, Gabriele, et al. Touching and Being Touched: Kinesthesia and Empathy in Dance and Movement. de Gruyter, 2013.

  Quote from Touching and Being Touched to point to the development of empathy through right brain engagement: 
  
"Etymologically, introspection means to look into one’s self, which is usually specified as one’s own mind or feelings. This interior space is the site of empathy, envisioned as contained within one’s self until it is drawn out by the object of one’s gaze, sympathy, or even pity. As Foster demonstrates in her study cited earlier, introspection is implicated in the scopic economy of the 19th-century self. Interoception, on the other hand, replaces the visual emphasis (spect) with the more tactile sensibility of cept. Used mostly in neuropsychology, the term “interoception” references one’s ability to feel sensations arising from within the body, specifically one’s visceral organs, giving us the term “gut feelings.” Advances in brain imaging over the last decade have helped scientists locate interoception in the right frontal insula, a part of the also identified with emotional intelligence. It could be easy to collapse these two terms into an overall feeling of empathy. But as any Zen master will tell you, feeling does not necessarily have to evolve into emotion. In fact, I want to suggest that the physical mind of interoception can produce an entirely different kind of empathic exchange, one that stays with feeling without getting stuck in the emotional baggage of feelings." 
  
  The book also introduces mirror neurons and their importance in the activation of the brain. Also discusses the healing capacities of Tango and Contact Improvisation and listening as the shift from left brain activation to right brain interoception.

Garrard, Peter. The Leadership Hubris Epidemic: Biological Roots and Strategies for Prevention. Softcover reprint of the original 1st ed. 2018, Palgrave Macmillan, 2018.

  Quote from The Leadership Hubris Epidemic to point to the left brain engagement that is common when individuals are motivated to approach: 
  
"Approach and avoidance are the two fundamental biological impulses underpinning all our behavior as animals. It is about survival: we want to approach certain things – for food and for sex – and we want to avoid certain things, to avoid being eliminated (Gray 1987). The approach system is closely linked to the dopamine (reward) system of the brain (Wacker et al, 2013), which tends to activate left frontal areas more than the right (Davidson 1992). Electrical brain recordings (EEG) show that people who are being made to think or remember a situation when they had power over someone, for instance sitting on an interview panel or in another position of power, activate the brain’s left-lateralised approach system (Boksem et al, 2012). This motivation to approach explains why Rodin’s statues – and indeed embracers the world over – strain slightly to the right, driven by the increased activity in the left frontal lobes of their brains." 
  
  The book also shares how the current hierarchical structures within the military, businesses and politics are breeding grounds for HUBRIS (the addiction to power).

Quotes to further detail persistent left brain engagement: 

"But something strikes you when you move to America and travel around the world: every education system on earth has the same hierarchy of subjects. Every one. Doesn't matter where you go. You'd think it would be otherwise, but it isn't. At the top are mathematics and languages, then the humanities. At the bottom are the arts. Everywhere on earth. And in pretty much every system, too, there's a hierarchy within the arts. Art and music are normally given a higher status in schools than drama and dance. There isn't an education system on the planet that teaches dance every day to children the way we teach them mathematics. Why? Why not? I think this is rather important. I think math is very important, but so is dance... 

Truthfully, what happens is, as children grow up, we start to educate them progressively from the waist up. And then we focus on their heads. And slightly to one side.

Our education system is predicated on the idea of academic ability. And there's a reason. Around the world, there were no public systems of education, really, before the 19th century. They all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism."
