## About the Collection 

This collection began as a discovery of key words related to domestic violence within periodicals of Arte Publico Press (APP). The collection quickly grew as key words continued to appear in the periodicals themselves and through parallel research external to APP. 

## Further Reading 

The following readings are the result of this parallel research and point to the possible directions of the collection;
