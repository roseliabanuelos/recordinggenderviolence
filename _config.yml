description: "Gender/Domestic/Intimate Partner violence is the willful intimidation, physical assault, battery, sexual assault, and/or other abusive behavior as part of a systematic pattern of power and control perpetrated by one intimate partner against another. It includes physical violence, sexual violence, and emotional abuse.

Domestic violence happens every minute, mostly behind closed doors.
In America, 24 people per minute experience rape, physical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner.
Nearly 30% of women and 10% of men experience rape, physical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner in America each year.
Roughly 25% of women and 14% of men have been suffered serious physical injuries as a result of physical violence by an intimate partner.
Nearly half of all women and men in America have experienced psychological aggression by an intimate partner.
Females ages 18-34 experience the highest level of intimate partner violence in the United States.
Nearly 50% of female homicides in the United States are committed by former or current intimate partners.
Intimate partner violence has grown by an estimated 40% in Harris County alone during COVID-19. (https://crime-stoppers.org/domestic-violence/)
 This collection explores articles, themes, and patterns within gender violence rhetoric promoted in periodicals from 1830 to 1989. The collection is in Spanish. All documents included can be found in Arte PÃºblico Press's database due to the hard work of Recovering the US Hispanic Literary Heritage program. Thank you all for founding, preserving and continuing the legacy. Si se puede. "
